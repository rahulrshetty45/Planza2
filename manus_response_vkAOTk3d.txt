Understood, I will create the CSV for you.I will do the following:
1. Read and analyze construction document
2. Extract key construction items with details
3. Create CSV file with extracted data
4. Deliver CSV file to user

You can interrupt me at any time during my work to provide new information or adjust the plan.I've successfully created a CSV file with 10 key construction items from the document for 130 Barrow Street Apt 215. The CSV includes the three columns you requested: Item, Location, and Specification.

The key items extracted include fire-resistant penetrations, smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, plumbing branch lines, electrical outlets, door openings, water line insulation, fire-resistant joint systems, mechanical ventilation, and grab bar reinforcement - all with their specific locations and detailed specifications as outlined in the construction document.
