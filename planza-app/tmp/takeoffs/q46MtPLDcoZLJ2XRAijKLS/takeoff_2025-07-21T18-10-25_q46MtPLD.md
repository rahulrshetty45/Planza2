## COST ESTIMATION IMPACT

### High Impact (Requires Field Measurement)
1. **All finish quantities** - Square footage and linear footage measurements required
2. **Cabinet linear footage** - Kitchen and storage cabinet measurements required
3. **Structural quantities** - Metal stud, gypsum board, and insulation square footage required

### Medium Impact (Requires Specification Research)
1. **Paint model numbers** - Specific Benjamin Moore product selection required
2. **Lighting specifications** - Fixture selection and electrical requirements required
3. **Window specifications** - Complete window specification required

### Low Impact (Standard Industry Practices)
1. **Fastener specifications** - Standard construction practices typically apply
2. **Installation tolerances** - Industry standard tolerances typically apply
3. **Minor hardware** - Standard hardware selections typically apply

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COST ESTIMATORS

### Field Verification Required
- Measure all floor, wall, and ceiling areas for finish quantity calculations
- Measure cabinet runs for millwork quantity calculations
- Verify existing conditions for demolition scope accuracy

### Specification Clarification Required
- Obtain specific paint product selections from Benjamin Moore
- Obtain lighting fixture specifications and electrical requirements
- Obtain complete window specifications for W1

### Standard Allowances Recommended
- Use standard fastener and hardware allowances based on industry practices
- Apply standard installation labor factors for specified systems
- Include standard contingencies for field verification items

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The provided construction documents are **comprehensive for design intent** but **require additional quantity takeoffs and specification clarification for accurate cost estimation**. The documents provide excellent quality and specification information but lack the dimensional data typically required for precise material quantity calculations.

**Estimated Additional Information Required:** 25-30% of total cost estimation data needs to be field-verified or clarified through additional specifications.
